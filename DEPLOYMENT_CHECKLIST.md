# Netlify Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. Database Setup
- [x] Neon database is created and accessible  
- [x] Database URL is hardcoded in `src/config/neon.ts`
- [ ] Database schema is migrated (run SQL commands from `NEON_SQL_COMMANDS.md`)
- [x] Database connection string includes SSL mode and channel binding

### 2. Firebase Setup
- [x] Firebase project is created
- [x] Authentication is enabled (Email/Password provider) 
- [x] Firebase configuration is hardcoded in `src/config/firebase.ts`
- [ ] Domain is added to authorized domains in Firebase

### 3. Groq AI Setup
- [x] Groq API keys are hardcoded in chat components
- [ ] API limits and quotas are understood

### 4. No Environment Variables Required
- [x] All configuration is hardcoded in the application
- [x] No environment variables need to be set in Netlify
- [x] Application is ready for immediate deployment

## Deployment Steps

1. **Connect Repository to Netlify:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update configuration and add conversation management"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - No environment variables to configure
   - Site should build and deploy automatically
   - All configuration is already in the codebase

3. **Verify Deployment:**
   - [ ] Site builds successfully
   - [ ] Database connections work
   - [ ] Authentication flows work  
   - [ ] Chat features respond correctly
   - [ ] Conversation history saves and loads
   - [ ] No console errors

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] Test all major features
- [ ] Test conversation creation and management
- [ ] Test user history persistence
- [ ] Monitor for any runtime errors
- [ ] Set up custom domain (if needed)

## Database Setup Commands

Run the SQL commands in `NEON_SQL_COMMANDS.md` in your Neon SQL Editor to create the required database schema.

## Security Notes

- All API keys and database URLs are now hardcoded in the application
- Firebase configuration uses public keys which is acceptable for client-side apps
- Groq API keys are embedded in the frontend code
- For production applications, consider using environment variables or server-side API proxies

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Netlify build logs for errors
2. Verify database connectivity in Neon console
3. Check Firebase configuration and domain settings
4. Verify Groq API keys are valid and have proper permissions
5. Check browser console for runtime errors
